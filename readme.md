## Introduction ##

RJK.FileSystem is a functional wrapper around the .Net File System. This allows all calls to appropriately curry the parameters and work form functions.

There are two basic entry points into this library.

`Builder.Accessor` which wraps all the static file system methods to allow for curried parameters.
`Builder.FileSystem` which wraps all the object based file system methods.
    

## Builder.Accessor ##
This is a functional wrapper around the static .Net FileSystem calls.

### Get Plain File System ###
This returns a `IFileSystemAccessor` with no events configured for capture.

The signature of this method is as follows:

```f#
// unit -> IFileSystemAccessor
let getPlainFileSystem () : IFileSystemAccessor
```
    

### Get File System ###
This returns a `IFileSystemAccessor` with events configured to be captured.

This method has the following signature:

```f#
// FileEventHandlers -> DirectoryEventHandlers -> IFileSystemAccessor
let getFileSystem fileEventHandlers dirEventHandlers : IFileSystemAccessor
```

The `FileEventHandlers` has the following structure:

```f#
type FileEventHandlers = {
    BeforeDelete : (IFileWrapper -> unit) option
    AfterDelete : (IFileWrapper -> unit) option
}
```

This allows access to a file before and after delete.

The `DirectoryEventHandlers` look very similar:

```f#
type DirectoryEventHandlers = {
    BeforeDelete : (IDirectoryWrapper -> unit) option
    AfterDelete : (IDirectoryWrapper -> unit) option
}
```

And this lets you have access to a Directory before and after it is deleted.
